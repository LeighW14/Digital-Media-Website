    <div class="artwork">
     <p><strong>Visual Storytelling:</strong> [For this project we had to tell a story with our own photos we took and use our creativity and the photography techniques we learned. My group conveyed the theme of growth in our story through the series of photos we took.]</p>

    <div class="artwork">
     <p><strong>Alphabet Photography:</strong> [For this project we had to take photos for each letter of our name but only by using the things we see around us and no letters. I had a lot of fun going around school searching for objects that could appear as each letter of my name.]</p>

    <div class="artwork">
 <p><strong>Logos:</strong> [For this project we had to create our own logos that represent our name using Adobe Illustrator. I wanted to make a logo that was vibrant and fun to have the logo not only show my name but show my personality!]</p>

    <div class="artwork">

      <p><strong>Meme Creation:</strong> [For this project we had to make our own relatable and funny meme using photoshop! It was really cool to tinker with photoshop and brainstorm meme ideas.]</p>

    <div class="artwork">
        <p><strong>Mood Board:</strong> [For this project we had to create our own hypothetical company and make a moodboard that represents our brand. I created my own clothing brand and had a lot of fun creating a moodboard because I was able to include my interests and really flush out what I wanted my brand to look like.]</p>

    <div class="artwork">
       <p><strong>Scavenger Hunt:</strong> [For this project we had to go around school and take photos for each prompt of a scavenger hunt. We tied this activity to our short unit on social media and we had to make a youtube thumbnail using our scavenger hunt photos. I made a thumbnail about a day in my life which I thought tied well with the photos we were taking in school and it was really fun to learn about social media and how it relates to the digital world.]</p>

      <div class="artwork">
       <p><strong>AI Art:</strong> [For this project we had to experiment with ai to create art with the prompts we would give it. We then had to write a short story based on the art we created. I used ai to create the image of a king in a city full of money. My short story ended up following a plot of this king who came from nothing and built a strong legacy. I really liked this project because I felt like I had the creative freedom to do anything!]</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This year in Digital Media, I learned many different things, just a few examples are coding, photography, and how to use Adobe Illustrator. I had a lot of fun experimenting with the various tools we learned how to use. I really enjoyed making memes, working on my mood board, and making logos because doing so let me apply my creativity. It was interesting to use AI to make art and tie it with my photography. My biggest challenge was definitely coding and building websites but I learned a lot and worked through my problems until I was happy with the result. I loved working with my peers and sharing and recieving feedback on the projects we made. Overall, this class was very fun, creative, and made me more confident in digital art!</p>

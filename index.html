    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This year in Digital Media, I learned many different things, just a few examples are coding, photography, and how to use Adobe Illustrator. I had a lot of fun experimenting and tinkering with the various tools we learned how to use. I really enjoyed making memes, working on my mood board, and making logos because doing so let me apply my creativity. It was interesting to use AI to make art and tie it with my photography. My biggest challenge was definitely coding and building websites but I learned a lot and worked through my problems until I was happy with the result. Overall, this class was very fun, creative, and made me more confident in digital art!</p>
